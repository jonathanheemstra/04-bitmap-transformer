## Bitmap Project:
This is a bitmap transformer built by Jonathan, Peter, and Britt.

In this project, we are converting the image below using different transforms:

##### Our transforms are as follows:
- Green
- Invert
- Greyscale
- Black
- White
- Luminosity

##### Green Transform Formula

> Multiply the green element (color value) of the RGBA array by the max number of colors minus one (256 - 1) or 255.

##### Black & White Transform Formula

> Fill the entire colorArray / its elements with 255 or 0.

##### Invert Transform Formula

> Subtract each color value (RGB) from 255.

##### Greyscale Transform Formula

> Average the RGB color values and set the color values to this average.

##### Luminosity Transform Formula

> Multiply the red color value by .21. Multiply the green color value by .72. Multiply the blue color value by .07.

To run this project locally, type the following into your terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/brittdawn/04-bitmap-transformer.git`
2. `npm i`
3. `node index.js`

The terminal will then prompt you: "Please enter one of the following: green, white, invert, greyscale, luminosity, black or all."

You may then type which transform you wish to implement, like so: `node index.js invert`.

You may now go to the assets folder and see your transformed image.

Repeat as you wish with other transforms.
